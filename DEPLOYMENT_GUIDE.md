## üß™ Testing Framework

### Integration Tests

The system includes a comprehensive test suite (`convex/integrationTests.ts`) that validates:

1. **Assignment Creation** - Form processing and configuration
2. **Response Processing** - Form submission handling
3. **Autograding Pipeline** - End-to-end grading workflow
4. **Batch Processing** - Scalable concurrent grading
5. **AI Grading System** - AI integration and confidence scoring
6. **Feedback Generation** - Personalized feedback creation
7. **Grade Export** - Multi-format export functionality
8. **Classroom Sync** - Google Classroom integration
9. **Result Publishing** - Student notification and analytics
10. **Error Handling** - Recovery and retry mechanisms

### Running Tests

```javascript
// In Convex dashboard or via API call
await api.integrationTests.runIntegrationTests({
  testMode: true, // Safe mode - won't affect real data
  testCourseId: "test-course-123",
  testAssignmentTitle: "Integration Test Assignment"
});
```

## üìà Performance & Scalability

### Database Schema

The system uses an optimized Convex schema with proper indexing:

- **Assignments**: Course, form, and user indexes
- **Submissions**: Multi-dimensional indexing for fast queries
- **Grading Sessions**: Status and time-based indexes
- **Sync Operations**: Assignment and operation type indexes

### Batch Processing

- **Configurable concurrency**: Control parallel processing limits
- **Memory management**: Efficient batch sizing
- **Error isolation**: Individual submission failure doesn't affect batch
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time status updates

### API Rate Limiting

- **Google Classroom API**: Respects quotas with exponential backoff
- **Intelligent retry logic**: Service-specific retry strategies
- **Circuit breaker patterns**: Prevents cascading failures

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **No sensitive data storage**: Only references to Google resources
- **Encrypted connections**: All API calls use HTTPS
- **Access controls**: Google OAuth for authentication
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive operation logging

### Privacy Compliance

- **Student data protection**: Minimal data retention
- **Anonymization options**: Export data without personal identifiers
- **Consent management**: Teacher-controlled data access
